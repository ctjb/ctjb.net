# 35c3 Hardware Exchange

We invite you to Hardware Exchange at the [CTJB](https://35c3.c3nav.de/l/ctjb/) assembly at 35c3!

Are you in need of a development board or another hardware for your cool project, but you don't have any?

Worry no more, we have a solution for you!

## How does it work?

1. Think of a project you need a hardware for (You already did that, right? Great!)
2. Come to the [CTJB](https://35c3.c3nav.de/l/ctjb/) assembly
3. Locate the dark grey sportbag (marked with #HWEX tag!) on the table (under the CTJB sign on the wall)
4. Take the hardware you want
5. (optional) Put another hardware piece in a box
6. Take a photo of the hardware you took and/or put inside
7. Put the photo on Twitter using hashtags #CTJB #HWEX #35c3, tell us what you plan to do using that piece!
8. Enjoy!
